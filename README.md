# Huffman and Kruskal Algorithm
Using two algorithm to run the input file for 10,100,1000,10000,100000 words.

- The Huffman And Kruskal Algorithm Question.pdf is the question.
- group205.pdf is the report for answering the question.
- Before run the algorithm, you will need to generate the input file by using group205_num02_kruskalwithoutpq_kruskalwithpq_am_input_files.cpp and group205_num06_huffmancoding_input_files.cpp
- Make sure all the input file are in one folder.
- In group205_num07_huffmancoding_all_outputs.cpp, make sure you put the correct input name and the input file is in the same folder.
